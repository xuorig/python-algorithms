# A* search algorithm

The A* algorithm is complete and will always find a solution if one exists.

A* uses a best-first search and finds the path of least cost from a start node to a goal node. As A* traverses the graph, it builds up a tree of partial paths. The leaves of this tree (the open-set) are stored in a priority queue that orders the leaf nodes by a cost function usually named f(), which combines a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach a goal and the distance traveled from the initial node. 

The cost function is usually calculated as `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` where `g(n)` is the distance traveled from the initial node to n and `h(n)` is the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal.

### Heursitics

#### Admissible

An heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.

#### Monotone (Consistent)

An heuristic function estimates the distance of a given state to a goal state, and that is always at most equal to the estimated distance from any neighboring vertex plus the step cost of reaching that neighbor.

Formally, for every node N and every successor P of N generated by any action a, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from N is no greater than the step cost of getting to P plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from P.
